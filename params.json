{"name":"Autocompile","tagline":"a tool to help generate makefile","body":"autocompile\r\n===========\r\n\r\na tool set to help generate makefile and build a tree structure\r\n\r\nautocompile tool set is targeting to manage a small or middle size project, free developpers from writting and updating makefiles, and build project tree from top level.\r\nautocompile tool set does not replace make or compiler, instead it generate makefile for make, and use compiler to detect source file dependencies.\r\n\r\nthis tool set contains two tools,\r\n\r\n1. autocompile\r\n\r\nit goes through current directory to looking for .c and .cpp files, generate dependencies according to g++ -MM output, and output makefile to stdout.\r\n\r\nautocompile looks for .autocompile from $HOMEPATH/.autocompile and ./.autocompile as configuration\r\n\r\n2. maketree\r\n\r\nit goes through current directory to looking for sub folders to compile, if a subfolder contains Makefile / makefile / GNUmakefile, it will call make, otherwise call maketree\r\n\r\nsupport command line parameters\r\n  - -1 use only one thread\r\n  - -v output the commands to run, instead of run them\r\n  - other command line parameters will be sent to make or child maketree process. say 'maketree autocompile' will run 'make autocompile' if Makefile exists, and 'maketree autocompile'.\r\n\r\nmaketree also looks for .autocompile from $HOMEPATH/.autocompile and ./.autocompile as configuration\r\n\r\nmaketree looks for dirs file in current folder to decide the folders ignored, and the dependencies between the folders\r\n\r\nusually you do not need to change anything to let autocompile and maketree work in linux or cygwin environments, except for these parameters\r\n\r\nin .autocompile file\r\n  - main\r\n  - out\r\n\r\nif you need to build a binary instead of object files from a source file, the detail of these parameters are in the follow section\r\n\r\nin dirs file\r\n  - folder1:folder2 folder3\r\n\r\nif folder1 depends on folder2 and folder3, i.e. folder1 can only be built after folder2 and folder3\r\n\r\n.autocompile can include\r\n  -

all-cmd\r\n\r\n    the make command to run in 'all' target, the 'all' target is a phony target by default, but you can provide a command for it. default value is empty.\r\n\r\n    alias all_cmd\r\n\r\n  - cc-flag\r\n\r\n    extra g++ options, default value is -std=c++11 -Wall -Wno-unused-function -Wno-unused-variable -O3\r\n\r\n    alias cc_flag, compiler-flag, compiler-option\r\n\r\n  - cc-flag2\r\n\r\n    extra g++ options, default value is empty, so you can change the compiling command but inherits the default options cc-flag provided.\r\n\r\n    alias cc_flag2, compiler-flag2, compiler-option2, extra-compiler-flag, extra-compiler-option\r\n\r\n  - dlink\r\n\r\n    the dynamic linking command for the compiler as boost::format string, default value is -l%1%\r\n\r\n    alias dynamic-link\r\n\r\n  - list\r\n\r\n    the system command to list .c and .cpp file, default value is ls -1 *.cpp *.c\r\n\r\n  - list-h\r\n\r\n    the system command to list .h and .hpp file, default value is ls -1 *.hpp *.h\r\n\r\n  - main\r\n\r\n    the name of the cpp file contains main, if this file is existing, the makefile will compile and link it, default value is main.cpp\r\n\r\n  - objs\r\n\r\n    the static libs link to the binary generated, separated by ',' ' ' or ';', default value is empty\r\n\r\n    alias libs, static-libs\r\n\r\n  - out\r\n\r\n    the output file name of the binary generated, default value is main\r\n\r\n    alias output\r\n\r\n  -

-folder\r\n\r\n    remove folder from build targets in current directory\r\n\r\n  - folder1:folder2 folder3\r\n\r\n    folder1 depends on folder2 and folder3\r\n\r\n    you can also write this line as\r\n\r\n    folder1 folder2 folder3\r\n\r\n\r\nexamples,\r\n\r\nthere are two example projects in the folder\r\n\r\n  - test-project\r\n\r\n    it shows how to use autocompile to generate Makefile, it has one .h file, one .hpp file, two .cpp files, while it also needs to include boost_system to compile. so the .autocompile file only needs to provide the dlibs as boost_system.\r\n\r\n    run ./autocompile.sh or ../autocompile > Makefile will generate Makefile against .autocompile.\r\n\r\n  - test-project2\r\n\r\n    it shows the combination of maketree and autocompile, while maketree can help to update Makefile by running 'maketree autocompile'. it will run 'make autocompile' in each folder with Makefile.\r\n\r\n    while there are several dirs files to show the dependencies between each folder.\r\n\r\n\r\nhowto,\r\n\r\n  - change compiler\r\n\r\n    if you would like to change compiler for a project, but do not want to change .autocompile files from all the folders, you can choose to create a .autocompile file in home folder, i.e. /home/<user-name>/.autocompile, and set cc parameter. i.e. 'cc clang++' in your .autocompile file. and run 'maketree autocompile' to update all the Makefiles in the project.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
